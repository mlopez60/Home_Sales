# Home_Sales
In this challenge, you'll use your knowledge of SparkSQL to determine key metrics about home sales data. Then you'll use Spark to create temporary views, partition the data, cache and uncache a temporary table, and verify that the table has been uncached.


This challenge consisted of using SparkSQL to sort through Home Sales data and determine different metrics. 
This challenge was pretty straightforward but showed the value of SparkSQL with large data sets.
